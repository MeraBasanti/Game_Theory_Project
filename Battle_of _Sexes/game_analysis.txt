Game-Theoretic Analysis of Battle of the Sexes

Payoff Matrix (Man, Woman):
                Woman
                Ballet  Fight
Man    Ballet  (1,2)   (0,0)
       Fight   (0,0)   (2,1)

1. Dominated Strategies:
   - Neither strategy is dominated for Man.
   - Neither strategy is dominated for Woman.
   - No strictly dominated strategies exist.

2. Best Responses:
   - If Woman plays Ballet, Man's payoffs are Ballet: 1, Fight: 0. Best response: Ballet.
   - If Woman plays Fight, Man's payoffs are Ballet: 0, Fight: 2. Best response: Fight.
   - If Man plays Ballet, Woman's payoffs are Ballet: 2, Fight: 0. Best response: Ballet.
   - If Man plays Fight, Woman's payoffs are Ballet: 0, Fight: 1. Best response: Fight.

3. Rationalizable Strategies:
   - We check for rationalizable strategies by performing iterated elimination of strictly dominated strategies and confirming best responses to beliefs. For Man, Ballet (payoffs: 1 if Woman plays Ballet, 0 if Fight) is not dominated by Fight (payoffs: 0 if Ballet, 2 if Fight), as 1 > 0 but 0 < 2. Similarly, for Woman, Ballet (payoffs: 2 if Man plays Ballet, 0 if Fight) is not dominated by Fight (payoffs: 0 if Ballet, 1 if Fight), as 2 > 0 but 0 < 1. Since no strategies are strictly dominated, no strategies are eliminated. Further, Ballet and Fight are best responses for Man if he believes Woman plays Ballet with probability $q \geq \frac{2}{3}$ or $q \leq \frac{2}{3}$, respectively, and for Woman if she believes Man plays Ballet with $p \geq \frac{1}{3}$ or $p \leq \frac{1}{3}$, respectively. Thus, all strategies are rationalizable. Result: Man's strategies: {Ballet, Fight}, Woman's strategies: {Ballet, Fight}.

4. Expected Payoffs:
   - Man: E_M = q + 2(1-p)(1-q)
   - Woman: E_W = 2p + (1-p)(1-q)

5. Pure Strategy Nash Equilibria:
   - (Ballet, Ballet): Man gets 1 (vs. 0 if Fight), Woman gets 2 (vs. 0 if Fight). Stable.
   - (Ballet, Fight): Man gets 0 (prefers Fight for 2), Woman gets 0 (prefers Ballet for 1). Unstable.
   - (Fight, Ballet): Man gets 0 (prefers Ballet for 1), Woman gets 0 (prefers Fight for 2). Unstable.
   - (Fight, Fight): Man gets 2 (vs. 0 if Ballet), Woman gets 1 (vs. 0 if Ballet). Stable.
   - Pure NE: (Ballet, Ballet) and (Fight, Fight).

6. Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium:
   - Man's indifference steps:
      2p \cdot 1 + (1-p) \cdot 0 = p \cdot 0 + (1-p) \cdot 1
      2p = 1-p
      3p = 1
      p = \frac{1}{3}
   - Woman's indifference steps:
      q \cdot 1 + (1-q) \cdot 0 = q \cdot 0 + (1-q) \cdot 2
      q = 2(1-q)
      q = 2 - 2q
      3q = 2
      q = \frac{2}{3}
   - Mixed NE: Man plays Ballet with $p = 1/3$, Fight with $2/3$; Woman plays Ballet with $q = 2/3$, Fight with $1/3$. Expected payoffs: $E_M = 2/3$, $E_W = 2/3$.
